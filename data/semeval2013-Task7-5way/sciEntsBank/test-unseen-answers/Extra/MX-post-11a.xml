  <questionText>Jim used a solid and water to make Mixture one (one spoon of solid in 100 milliliters water was clear with nothing on the bottom), Mixture 3 (3 spoons of solid in 100 milliliters water was clear with nothing on the bottom), Mixture 4 (4 spoons of solid in 100 milliliters water was clear with material on the bottom), and Mixture 5 (5 spoons of solid in 100 milliliters water was clear with material on the bottom) as shown below.

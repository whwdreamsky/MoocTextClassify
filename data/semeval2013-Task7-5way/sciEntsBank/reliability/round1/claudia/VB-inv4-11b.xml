     <studentAnswer id="VB.11b.117.1" accuracy="correct">Top right car, Bottom right car. The front end has a big point and the wheels are the same and big and small.</studentAnswer>
     <studentAnswer id="VB.11b.211.1" accuracy="partially_correct_incomplete">Top left car, Bottom left car. Because one has one small wheel and one big wheel and the other has 2 same size.</studentAnswer>
     <studentAnswer id="VB.11b.405.1" accuracy="contradictory">Top left car, Top right car. They both have the same wheels on each side but the tips are different.</studentAnswer>
     <studentAnswer id="VB.11b.418.1" accuracy="irrelevant">Top left car, Bottom left car. I circled those carts because one cart has a flat body, the other is a little uneven.</studentAnswer>

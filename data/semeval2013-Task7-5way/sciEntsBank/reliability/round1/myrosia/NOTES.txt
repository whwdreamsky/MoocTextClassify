VB-inv4-11b.xml should be dropped, it seems to be too strange, with
part of the answer in the question itself.

SE-post-45.xml -- not clear how much implied is allowed. There needs
to be some more principled pedagogical explanation. Decided to go with
"have to explicitly mention/imply that the shadow is in the opposite
direction of the sun"

PS-post-15b.xml -- again, need domain knowledge. Decided that both
"longest" and "fattest" are equally relevant.

MX-inv1-22a.xml -- not enough chemistry knowledge; need to see facets;
can a solution be taken appart? Went with "irrelevant" everywhere
because it is not clear what is being contradicted. BUT: this may be
against Beetle annotation; I was trying to stay with the facet-based
principles without seeing the facets.

LF-inv4-26a2.xml -- what were the facets? Decided that "easiest way"
is a good enough proxy for "trail steepest" and so should be correct.

II-inv3-20b.xml -- last question, decided that "different" is key, and
so it should be irrelevant and taken as just repeating the info from
question text.

FN-inv2-24c.xml -- 386.1 decided on "irrelevant" because decided that
"how much gas" is critical for making the answer work.

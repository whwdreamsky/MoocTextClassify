SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbj46-l1.qa107	same thing
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbj47-l1.qa121	both function the same and interfer with the bulb turning on
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbj48-l1.qa95	they both creat gaps in the path
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb1-l1.qa81	it has the same effect .
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb2-l1.qa89	they both create gaps .
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb3-l1.qa96	i dont know
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb4-l1.qa81	it is very similar
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb5-l1.qa91	they behave identically
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb7-l1.qa81	they are similar .
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb9-l1.qa84	the effect is the same . they both create a gap .
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb11-l1.qa83	it would not appear to be damaged , because an open switch creates a gap .
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb12-l1.qa84	they both create a gap in the circuit
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb13-l1.qa82	they both have a gap .
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb15-l1.qa83	they both have the ability to create gaps .
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb16-l1.qa83	same result , but a switch can be closed
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb18-l1.qa90	it works the same way .
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb19-l1.qa86	the switch can close and the gap would be gone but the a damaged bulb will always have a gap in the circuit
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb20-l1.qa92	a damaged bulb creates a gap in the path . an open switch creates a gap in the path .
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb24-l1.qa87	they both act the same way
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb25-l1.qa83	open switch is just creating a gap , nothing is being damaged .
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb26-l1.qa81	they have an identical impact on the circut .
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb29-l1.qa84	it acts in the same way , creating a gap
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb30-l1.qa81	a damaged bulb has the same effect as an open switch .
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb31-l1.qa81	they both damage the circuit
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb32-l1.qa83	it creates an open gap .
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb34-l1.qa81	the damabed bulb and the open switch disrupt the flow of the current .
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb35-l1.qa81	they are functionally the same .
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb36-l1.qa81	the damaged bulb does the same thing as an open switch by creating a gap but the damaged bulb can not fix its self to recreate the current as a switch can turn the current on and off .
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb37-l1.qa81	the both don '' t work
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb38-l1.qa82	both a damaged bulb and open switch will disconnect the circuit .
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb40-l1.qa81	they are the same because they create a gap .
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb41-l1.qa82	an open switch means a closed pathway , where as a damaged bulb means a gap , and they both cause the circuit not to work properly .
SwitchesBulbsSeries-DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q.sbjb42-l1.qa82	it creates the same effect
DAMAGED_BULB_SWITCH_Q	how does a damaged bulb compare to an open switch ?

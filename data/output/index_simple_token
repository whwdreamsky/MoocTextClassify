SwitchesBulbsParallel-OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb40-l2.qa112	When bulb a is burnt out then b and c still have a contained path . when bulb b is burnt out then c does not have a direct path yet a does . when bulb c is burnt out then b does not have a contained paht but a does
SwitchesBulbsParallel-OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb41-l2.qa113	Bulb A is a direct closed pathway to the battery , and if it is burned out or damaged , so is every other bulb . If bulb B is damaged , only bulb C is affected because it is on the same pathway as bulb B and vise versa .
SwitchesBulbsParallel-OPT2_EXPLAIN_Q.sbjb42-l2.qa112	Bulbs B and C are contained in the same path , so the status of these bulbs will affect each other and have no affect on bulb A. Bulb A is on its own path , so it will not have an affect on bulbs B and C .
